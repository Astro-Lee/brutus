#### _**Et tu, Brute?**_

`brutus` is a Pure Python package that uses Bayesian inference
to derive distances, reddening, and stellar properties from photometry. It
runs over the MIST stellar models and SED prediction engine taken from
`minesweeper` and was partially inspired by `frankenz`.

### Documentation
**Currently nonexistent.**

### Installation
`brutus` can be installed by running
```
python setup.py install
```
from inside the repository.

### Demos
Several ipython notebooks currently outline very basic usage of the code.
