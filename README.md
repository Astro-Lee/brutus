#### _**Et tu, Brute?**_

`brutus` is a Pure Python package that uses Bayesian inference
to derive distances, reddening, and stellar properties from photometry. It
runs over the MIST stellar models and SED prediction engine taken from
`minesweeper` and was partially inspired by `frankenz`.

### Data
The MIST grid used in the analysis can be found
[here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mxx2m07am2tptc0/grid_v4.1.h5?dl=0) (v4.1).
A previous version can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0gttqnmfr1orp85/grid_v4.h5?dl=0) (v4).

### Documentation
**Currently nonexistent.**

### Installation
`brutus` can be installed by running
```
python setup.py install
```
from inside the repository.

### Demos
Several ipython notebooks currently outline very basic usage of the code.
