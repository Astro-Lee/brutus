`brutus` is a Pure Python package whose core modules involve using
"brute force" Bayesian inference to derive distances, reddenings, and 
stellar properties from photometry.

The package is designed to be highly modular, with current modules including
utilities for modeling individual stars, star clusters, and 3-D dust mapping.

Please contact Josh Speagle (jspeagle@cfa.harvard.edu) with any questions.
